Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Data

Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning model for sentiment analysis of social media text data. The primary goal is to classify text (such as tweets or product reviews) into distinct sentiment categories: positive, negative, or neutral. This type of analysis is crucial for understanding public opinion, tracking brand reputation, and gaining insights from large volumes of user-generated content.

The project demonstrates a complete end-to-end pipeline for a typical Natural Language Processing (NLP) task, from data acquisition and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Features
Data Loading: Handles loading of large social media datasets (e.g., Sentiment140).

Robust Text Preprocessing: Includes steps like lowercasing, URL/mention/hashtag removal, punctuation/number stripping, tokenization, stop word removal, and lemmatization using NLTK.

Feature Engineering: Converts raw text into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, with support for n-grams.

Machine Learning Model: Utilizes Logistic Regression as the primary classification algorithm, a strong and interpretable baseline for text classification.

Model Evaluation: Provides comprehensive evaluation metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix to assess model performance.

Prediction Functionality: Includes a utility to predict the sentiment of new, unseen text inputs.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

numpy: For numerical operations.

nltk (Natural Language Toolkit): For advanced text preprocessing tasks.

scikit-learn: For machine learning model implementation (TF-IDF, Logistic Regression, model evaluation metrics).

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization (e.g., Confusion Matrix).

Dataset
This project is designed to work with social media sentiment datasets. By default, it attempts to load the Sentiment140 dataset, which contains 1.6 million tweets classified as either positive or negative.

To use the full Sentiment140 dataset:

Download the training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv file from Kaggle:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140

Place this .csv file in the same directory as the sentiment_analysis.py script.

If the dataset is not found, the script will automatically use a smaller, internal dummy dataset for demonstration purposes.

Installation
Clone the repository (or download the sentiment_analysis.py file):

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis-social-media.git](https://github.com/Darshaksai2/sentiment-analysis-social-media.git)
cd sentiment-analysis-social-media

(Replace your-username and sentiment-analysis-social-media with your actual GitHub details)

Install required Python libraries:

pip install pandas scikit-learn nltk matplotlib seaborn

Download NLTK data: The script will attempt to download necessary NLTK corpora (stopwords, punkt, wordnet, omw-1.4) automatically upon first run. If you encounter any LookupError during execution, you can manually download them via the Python interpreter:

python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('stopwords')"
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('punkt')"
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('wordnet')"
python -c "import nltk; nltk.download('omw-1.4')"

Usage
To run the sentiment analysis script:

python sentiment_analysis.py

The script will:

Check for and download NLTK resources.

Load the dataset (or use the dummy data).

Perform text preprocessing.

Extract features using TF-IDF.

Train a Logistic Regression model.

Evaluate the model's performance on a test set, printing a classification report and displaying a confusion matrix plot.

Demonstrate sentiment prediction on a few example phrases.

Project Structure

└── README.md              # This README file
└── training.1600000.processed.noemoticon.csv  # (Optional) Place your dataset here

Results and Evaluation
The script will output the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for the positive, negative, and neutral sentiment classes (if applicable to the dataset). A confusion matrix will also be displayed, providing a visual breakdown of correct and incorrect classifications.

Typical results for the Sentiment140 dataset (binary classification) with Logistic Regression and TF-IDF often show accuracy in the range of 75-85%, depending on the preprocessing and feature engineering choices.

Future Enhancements
Explore other ML models: Experiment with Multinomial Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (LinearSVC), or ensemble methods like Random Forest.

Deep Learning Models: Implement more advanced models such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) like LSTMs or GRUs, or even Transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) for potentially higher accuracy, especially with larger and more complex datasets.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model hyperparameters.

Emoji and Emoticon Handling: Develop more sophisticated methods to interpret sentiment conveyed by emojis and emoticons.

Negation Handling: Implement techniques to correctly interpret negated phrases (e.g., "not good" vs. "good").

Deployment: Create a simple web application (using Flask, FastAPI, or Streamlit) to expose the sentiment prediction model via an API or a user interface.

Real-time Data Integration: Connect to social media APIs (e.g., Twitter API) to perform real-time sentiment analysis.
